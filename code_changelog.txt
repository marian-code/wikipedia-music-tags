To-Do ###################################

    - acoustic, instrumental, orcghestral tracks have the same composer as ones
      without these labels
    - maybe bypass the dict method of passing data to save function
    - still no json load
    - potentialy separate scripts from lib and make lib a standalone package!!!
      this should solve all sorts of problems with imports ...
    - try Pool.starmap_Async to load lyrics while other things are done -
      introduces more complexity and reduces code readability -
      maybe not a great idea
    - need to reevaluate speed and possibly get rid of lazy imports -
      sometimes they cause weird interactions
    - frozen code doesnt run on x86 systems, need 32bit python installation to
      build 32bit app
    - implement timeout errors - cannot seem to cath it probably originates
      from other module
    - parser probably should have its own lock - access to its variables
      should be guarded - see 13.1.2019 entry in this log
    - freezed Qt app is too big ~ 0.65GB - most files probably not needed
    - consider using mutagen https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
    - use "zip_include_packages" in cx_freeze setup to reduce size refer to
      https://github.com/anthony-tuininga/cx_Freeze/issues/256 and
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27281317/cx-freeze-preventing-including-unneeded-packages
    - add support for PySide2 and PyQt4


Individual problem cases 
    - load guests as in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Forest_and_the_Blackbird
    - load composer fails for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pursuit_of_the_Sun_%26_Allure_of_the_Earth
    - tracklist not found here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethera

Change Log ##############################

#14.1.2019
    Added cover art search

#13.1.2019 
    got rid of the global statements functions do not make a local copying
    of object as it is done with variables, they simply reference the original
    object
    major cleanup in locks - most were not needed as they where guarding
    atomic operations
    marked non-atomic operations on parser object, for now they are without
    lock since all operations on parser should be done serialy
    major reorganization of tag writing function
    moved wrappers to __init__

#12.1.2019 
    started test for retrieving images in tests/cover_art.py
    using https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download#summary
    quite starightforward need to make only fronted - some popup window
    selected pic will be resized and the copied to clipboard to paste mp3tag
    do not use tineye - too complicated

#11.1.2019
    Added super-duper hack with subclassing QStandarditem so we can display
    full path in the detail window effortlessly
    codebase for gui now has ~30% less lines
    added button for searching for each track file
    use decorators for exceptions where aplicable
    fixed few bugs caused by differences between Tkiniter and PyQt
    fixed bug - writing tags overides any manually assigned files to tracks
    added setup_qt.py for freezing the Qt version of app
    some code cleanup and reorganizing
    freezed Qt app is too big ~ 0.5GB - most files probably not needed
    tcl files are not needed but cx_freeze includes them


#10.1.2019
    Continue porting efforts. Much of the things can be done in similar way 
    only with minor alterations.
    All methods are now ported to PyQt5.
    Need to port some remaining detailes, and fix bugs.
    Need to come up with some workarounds or new approaches, since PyQt
    philosophy is different from Tkiniter
    Extensive testing is needed.

#9.1.2019
    started porting to PyQt data reading from HDD and sorting in table
    is now working. Sorting is much more elgant than in tkinter.
    Need to addres the issue with PyQt not tracking variables though.
    This is much simpler in Tkiniter.

#18.9.2018
    composers extraction has been completely reworked
    should be more robust. the function now inputs data
    directly to tracklist_composeres list
    new method for offline debugging has been implemented 
    reads the wikipedia.page object from picle file on disc
    implemented saving of wikipedia.page to disk
    new re_init method in sync class to avoid overwriting 
    variables at the start of the run
    added signal handler to catch ctrt-C and exit gracefully
    removed tracklist_composeres, now we have only composers
    which is a 2D list
    started code update to PEP8 style coding

#27.8.2018
    improved, more robust methods for extracting genres and release dates
    implemented cover art download from wikipedia
    substantial improvement to wiki page selection
    added removing (bonus track) and similar appended strings in brackets
    from track names
    added checking track name <--> file name, not against whole path as this
    caused some wrong matching when album had the same name as one of the tracks
    added thorough check for band name on the found page if other band than the one
    that was input is found user is asked if he wants to continue the search

#26.8.2018
    added workaround when there is no page content
    made json dump optional

#25.8.2018
    added copying of NLTK data to build folder to setup.py
    without it program was unable to run on diferent PCs
    now we are able to read tracklists which are not 
    formated in table
    bracket behind track is now checked for special characters like , / \ etc.
    which indicates that more artist is present the string is than split on
    theese delimiters and all are checked against aditional personnel
    parser now has its own logger to catch exceptions on lower level and not 
    halt the main thread
    minor tweak to ID3_tags.py .mp3 files apparently also have lyrics under LYRICS taglib
    same as .m4a

#24.8.2018
    some further code reorganize
    added logger to ID3_tags
    hopefully all possible exceptions are now caught
    and subsequently sent to corespondind logger, displayed
    in GUI and printed to console
    added log_print function to GUI which takes care of 
    logging, printing and sending messages to gui
    some gui polishing, either tkinter is worth shit or I am
    working with it is really painful

#23.8.2018
    now all modeles that can be, are lazy imported
    some lazy imports had to be omitted as they caused 
    some weird interactions which resulted in throwing 
    exceptions.
    
#22.8.2018
    solved problems with parser import
    package has now new structure

#21.8.2018
    finally caught the sneaky bug causing the sys.stdout.flush() exception
    it was in multiprocessing.process . stdout apparently can be None
    in some situations in which case flush causes attribute error
    thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37212551/cx-freeze-using-sys-stdout-flush-and-multiprocessing
    the bug is probably related to multiprocessing freeze_support()

#20.8.2018
    problems with imports parser is not imported in spawned
    processes
    added icons

#15.8.2018
    freeze support is now working for the consolee app

    non-trivial modifications to lyricsfinder needed in order for 
    itÂ´s imports to work properly

    gui freeze support is partialy working now there is some wild bug in lyrics module
    setup.py is now one unified file for GUI and console app
    first implementation of logging, this prooves to be mighty
    usefull for debugging compiled GUI app
    need to use it moooar!!!

#14.8.2018
    various bug fixes
    improved search for composer names
    started work on freeze support, cx_freeze was chosen

#13.8.2018
    implemented advanced sorting of columns
    lyrics download is now parallel 
    this gives1.5x - 2x speed
    GUI now displayes in the title what is going on
    variious bug fixes
    implemented sorting when reading data from disc

#12.8.2018
    separate lyrics method is now working
    some wild spaces flying around in entries with
    multiple items separated by commas
    first basic concept of sortin is implemented
    reload from disc now works
    interactive console mode abandoned in favour of gui

#11.8.2018
    separate method for downloading lyrics only
    file matching to song titles repaired

#2.7.2018
    started to develop binding between console app and gui
    its a mess, need to research other methods

#26.6.2018
    we have working input
    there is no output yet

#24.6.2018
    works on gui started

#22.6.2018
    testing of recursive functions to use in COMPLETE
    for simplicity, less lines and maybe redability :D
    minor tweaks to how CDs are identified
    artists in columns after tracks are now loaded to 
    artist if header has no corresponding labbel 
    or to composers if one of the deffined labels is found

#21.6.2018
    added lazy lodaing for better startup speed
    addeed some multiprocessing and threading to further impove speed
    mainly to lyrics dowloading
    some other optimizations and code cleanup
    wikipedia parser class is noew loded from __init__

#20.6.2018
    doplneny json dump aby sa udaje nemuseli stale stahovat
    vsetky premenne su teraz ulozene v class
