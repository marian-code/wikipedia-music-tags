<ul>
<li>acoustic, instrumental, orcghestral tracks have the same composer as ones without these labels</li>
<li>maybe bypass the dict method of passing data to save function</li>
<li>still no json load</li>
<li>potentialy separate scripts from lib and make lib a standalone package!!! this should solve all sorts of problems with imports ...</li>
<li>try Pool.starmap_Async to load lyrics while other things are done - introduces more complexity and reduces code readability - maybe not a great idea</li>
<li>need to reevaluate speed and possibly get rid of lazy imports - sometimes they cause weird interactions</li>
<li>frozen code doesnt run on x86 systems, need 32bit python installation to build 32bit app</li>
<li>implement timeout errors - cannot seem to cath it probably originates from other module</li>
<li>parser probably should have its own lock - access to its variables should be guarded - see 13.1.2019 entry in changelog</li>
<li>freezed Qt app is too big ~ 0.65GB - most files probably not needed</li>
<li>consider using mutagen <a href="https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">mutagen</a> instead of pytaglib</li>
<li>use &quot;zip_include_packages&quot; in cx_freeze setup to reduce size refer to:<br>

</ul>
<h3 id="1892018">18.9.2018</h3>

<h3 id="2782018">27.8.2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>improved, more robust methods for extracting genres and release dates</li>

<li>substantial improvement to wiki page selection</li>
<li>added removing (bonus track) and similar appended strings in brackets from track names</li>

<li>added thorough check for band name on the found page if other band than the one that was input is found user is asked if he wants to continue the search</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2682018">26.8.2018</h3>

<li>now we are able to read tracklists which are not formated in table</li>
<li>bracket behind track is now checked for special characters like , / \ etc. which indicates that more artists are present. The string is than split on these delimiters and all are checked against aditional personnel</li>
<li>parser now has its own logger and catches exceptions on lower level which does not halt the main thread</li>
<li>minor tweak to ID3_tags.py .mp3 files apparently also have lyrics under LYRICS tag same as .m4a</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2482018">24.8.2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>some further code reorganize</li>
<li>added logger to ID3_tags</li>
<li>hopefully all possible exceptions are now caught and subsequently sent to corespondind logger, displayed in GUI and printed to console</li>
<li>added log_print function to <a href="http://application.py">application.py</a> which takes care of logging, printing and sending messages to gui</li>
<li>some gui polishing, either tkinter is worth shit or I am. Working with it is really painful</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2382018">23.8.2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>now all modeles that can be, are lazy imported</li>
<li>some lazy imports had to be omitted as they caused some weird interactions which resulted in throwing exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2282018">22.8.2018</h3>

<li>package has now new structure</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2182018">21.8.2018</h3>
<ul>
<li>finally caught the sneaky bug causing the sys.stdout.flush() exception. It was in multiprocessing.process. stdout apparently can be None in some situations in which case flush of the stream causes attribute error. Thanks to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37212551/cx-freeze-using-sys-stdout-flush-and-multiprocessing">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37212551/cx-freeze-using-sys-stdout-flush-and-multiprocessing</a> I got It.</li>
